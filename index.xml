      <description>Hello, and welcome to my website. Ever since diving into the world of computers and technology, I&amp;rsquo;ve become more curious about all things underground in this arena. I enjoy learning about everything from nation state campaigns, computing and hacking history, and more. In my spare time, I work on variety of challenges, whether that is hackthebox.eu, crackmes.one, CTFtime.org, and many others. I&amp;rsquo;m currently most interested in reverse engineering.
In no strict order or apparent schema, you&amp;rsquo;ll see me writing about various topics.</description>

      <description>In my last post I demonstrated a very simple .NET crackme. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll write about a Bordland Delphi file from crackmes.one, walk through some of the assembly and create a keygen in python. Delphi files are new to me so this will be a first.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the README.
The author is TripleTordo, releasing the crackme on December 20, 2010 with a difficulty level of 1/10. It&amp;rsquo;s his third crackme.</description>

      <description>After downloading and extracting the crackme, Detect It Easy verifies it is a .NET executable.
On my FLARE VM, I put the program in the dotNET directory. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the &amp;ldquo;ILSpy&amp;rdquo; utility.
After dragging and dropping, expanding InfoSecInstitute_dotNET_Reversing and going to Form1 will give us a decompilation.
As you can see, the password is pretty much right there and that&amp;rsquo;s all we need to do for this crackme.
If we look at the program itself, it consists of a simple popup where you input a password and press the check button.</description>
