Credit goes to Dennis Yurichev for his work on https://challenges.re. I really enjoy this resource because many of the problems are straight up assembly code and your goal is to find out what's going on. It's really efficient as far as finding a problem to work at to keep your assembly skills sharp.

In problem #2, Dennis presents us with the following assembly:

``` nasm
mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x4]
bswap  eax
mov    edx,eax
and    eax,0xf0f0f0f
and    edx,0xf0f0f0f0
shr    edx,0x4
shl    eax,0x4
or     eax,edx
mov    edx,eax
and    eax,0x33333333
and    edx,0xcccccccc
shr    edx,0x2
shl    eax,0x2
or     eax,edx
mov    edx,eax
and    eax,0x55555555
and    edx,0xaaaaaaaa
add    eax,eax
shr    edx,1
or     eax,edx
ret
```

If we inspect it at a higher level, we can see it is somewhat broken up into 3 sections. The back-to-back and instructions might help delineate it.

I wrote the following python code to represent the above.
